# Hash Radish
### By Jake Murray
---
Hash Radish is an easy to use, lightweight hashing program that can be used on
any operating system with Python 3.10 or newer installed.
Hashes are a great way to verify the integrity of information. Hash Radish
will give you an easy to use method for generating hashes with the option of 
several different hashing algorithms. 

As hashing is widely used for data integrity verification, I have only included
NIST approved hashing functions in this program. 
You can read more about approved hashing functions [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/hash-functions).


## Features
- Easily select from several algorithm options
- You can hash either user input or files
- Hashes can be exported for later use (coming soon)

## Libraries
#### hashlib
Part of the Python standard library. This is the library that is being used
to hash the user input.
